# python-challenge
# Background
In this assignment, you'll use the concepts you've learned to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.

# Before You Begin
Before starting the assignment, be sure to complete the following steps:
1. Create a new repository for this project called python-challenge.
2. Clone the new repository to your computer.
3. Inside your local Git repository, create a folder for each Python assignment and name them PyBank and PyPoll.
4. In each folder that you just created, add the following content:
* A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.
* A Resources folder that contains the CSV files you used. Make sure that your script has the correct path to the CSV file.
* An analysis folder that contains your text file that has the results from your analysis.
5. Push these changes to GitHub.

# PyBank Instructions
In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
Create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
* The total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes.
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
Your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

# PyPoll Instructions
In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
* The total number of votes cast.
* A complete list of candidates who received votes.
* The percentage of votes each candidate won.
* The total number of votes each candidate won.
* The winner of the election based on popular vote.
Your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
